This is designed for newbies in the web3 space. This is addressed to people with basic knowledge and experience in web development and software engineering.

Here you will find tutorials and places to reach out sorted for each protocol and ecosystem.

As of now, I am creating this to help prepare people for the [ETHRome Hackathon](https://ethrome.org) - if you are not signed up yet feel free to [Apply to hack!](https://form.jotform.com/231801898940060). This repo should assist you during the hackathon, this is why in its current form is focused on the Hackathon Bounty sponsors. I'm happy to extend and invite others to extend this further for other ecosystems like Polkadot, NEAR and much more. Everyone is welcome to create a PR and help me with the mission to onboard new devs to web3!

Let us get started!
